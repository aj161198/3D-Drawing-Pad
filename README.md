# Virtual-Drawing-Pad


A very basic drawing pad made to explore various features of OpenCV library.

Steps Involved:- 
1. Object segmentation via color thresholding.
2. Identification of contours to calculate moments 
3. Calculation of centroid of the given contour.
4. Simulation with Track-Bars and Pixel overwriting.
